# Monitoring

This directory contains monitoring components for the e-commerce ML pipeline, focusing on observability and metrics collection.

## Components

### Metrics Collection

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Implementations for collecting and exposing metrics
- **Model Performance Tracking**: Metrics for recommendation quality and model drift
- **Service Health Monitoring**: Latency, throughput, and error rate tracking

### Integration Points

- **Prediction Service**: Metrics are exposed via the `/metrics` endpoint in the FastAPI service
- **Prometheus**: Scrapes metrics from the prediction service
- **Grafana**: Visualizes metrics with customizable dashboards

## Metrics Categories

1. **System Metrics**
   - Service latency (p50, p95, p99)
   - Request throughput
   - Error rates
   - Resource utilization (CPU, memory)

2. **Business Metrics**
   - Recommendation click-through rate
   - Conversion rate from recommendations
   - User engagement metrics

3. **Model Metrics**
   - Prediction confidence
   - Model drift indicators
   - Feature distribution changes

## Dashboard Setup

Grafana dashboards are configured in the `docker/monitoring/` directory, with pre-built dashboards for:
- Service performance monitoring
- Recommendation quality tracking
- User engagement analysis
